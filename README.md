### Hi, I'm Arthur Lafrance. I'm...

* A 2nd year CS student @ UCI
* A software developer who's usually making fun/cool/weird stuff in my free time
* Broadly interested in AI/machine learning, programming language design, & software engineering

#### I'm currently working on several ongoing projects:

* [Pensiv](https://www.github.com/arthurlafrance/pensiv): A Rust-based AI & machine learning library that doubles as a place for me to experiment with both Rust and AI/ML.
* [Tapestry](https://tapestrylearn.com): A code visualization tool that generates diagrams for Python code, inspired by the legendary Professor Pattis.
