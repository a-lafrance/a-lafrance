### Hi, I'm Arthur Lafrance. I'm...

* A CS student @ UCI
* A software developer who's usually making fun/cool/weird stuff in my free time
* Broadly interested in computer architecture/systems, programming languages, & software engineering

#### Some of my work, both past & present:

* [Tapestry](https://tapestrylearn.com): Code visualization tool that dynamically generates diagrams for Python code, inspired by the one and only Professor Pattis.
* Well, actually... most other projects that could go here are unfinished, but if/when they're done they'll end up here.
