### Hi, I'm Arthur Lafrance. I'm...

* A CS student @ UCI
* A software developer who's usually making fun/cool/weird stuff in my free time
* Broadly interested in computer architecture/systems, programming languages, AI/machine learning, & software engineering

#### Some stuff I'm currently working on:

* [Pensiv](https://www.github.com/arthurlafrance/pensiv): A Rust-based AI & machine learning library I'm building from the ground up.
* [Tapestry](https://tapestrylearn.com): A visualization tool that generates diagrams for Python code, inspired by the one and only Professor Pattis.
