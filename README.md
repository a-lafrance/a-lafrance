### Hi! I'm Arthur Lafrance. I'm...

* A 2nd year CS student @ UCI
* Interested in AI & machine learning (mainly reinforcement learning, NLP, & neural networks/deep learning for those curious)
* A software developer with full-stack web & iOS development experience

#### I'm currently working on several ongoing projects:

* [Tapestry](https://tapestrylearn.com): A code visualization tool that generates diagrams for Python code, inspired by the legendary Professor Pattis.
* [Pensiv](https://www.github.com/arthurlafrance/pensiv): A Rust-based AI & machine learning library that doubles as a place for me to experiment with both Rust and AI/ML.
* [BotNet](https://www.github.com/arthurlafrance/BotNet): An ongoing collection of miscellaneous AI-based programs I feel inspired to write, packaged in a simple CLI.
